## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Throughout the course, we will work with R markdown. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It is also useful, to combine R code and written text/ explanations.

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a cheatsheet where you can find the most important information about R Markdown:

<https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf>

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Remark: You can also find parts of this tutorial at the webbook version of this great book: "R for Data Science". It is very well written and always a good starting point if you need help with R. You can find it online at
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html>.



So to get started, we will load some packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run if you have not installed the packages yet
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("n-kall/IDA2019-package")

# Load required packages for our course
# (You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session)

library(IDA2019)

# Today is all about the tidyverse, so it would also suffice to load only this package:
library(tidyverse)
```
 


###  1. Tidy data

In order to learn something about R, we have prepared some data visualization and exploration tasks for you, using the `mpg` data frame found in ggplot2 (aka `ggplot2::mpg`).
The data frame mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car


```{r }
# display the data set mpg
mpg


```

We can explore the data even better to get an idea what it looks like:

```{r }
head(mpg) # gives you the first 10 entries

tail(mpg) # gives you?

summary(mpg)
```

To learn even more about `mpg` and the meaning of its variables, open its help page by running ?mpg.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mpg
```

Among the variables in mpg are:

- `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

-  `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.


### 2. GGplot

Now we will do some plotting, because a picture tells you more than thousand words. 
To plot mpg, run this code to put `displ` on the x-axis and `hwy` on the y-axis:

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```


The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (`displ`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?

With ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`. `ggplot()` creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph. So `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.

You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to `ggplot()`. The function `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this course.

Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The `mapping argument` is always paired with `aes()`, and the `x` and `y` arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the `data` argument, in this case, `mpg`.

So a very basic ggplot. template would look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
  
  
  
#### Intermediate exercises:
- Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

- How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
```{r}

```

- What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
```{r}

```

- Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
```{r}

```
- What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}

```



plot some simple things
# pipe and data wrangling:

group_by
summarise
filter




```{r}

```


```{r}

```

###
```{r}

```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
