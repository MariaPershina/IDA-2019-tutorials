## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Throughout the course, we will work with R markdown. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It is also useful, to combine R code and written text/ explanations.

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a cheatsheet where you can find the most important information about R Markdown:

<https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf>

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Remark: You can also find parts of this tutorial at the webbook version of this great book: "R for Data Science". It is very well written and always a good starting point if you need help with R. You can find it online at
<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html>.


```{r}
1+2
```

You can supress an output by setting ECHO=False
Default eval= True. Set False if you do not want a cell to be executed. 

Example


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Run if you have not installed the packages yet
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("n-kall/IDA2019-package")

# Load required packages for our course
# (You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session)
library(IDA2019)

# Today is all about the tidyverse, so it would also suffice to load only this package:
library(tidyverse)
```
 
# RStudio

## Vectors/ data types

Vectors are particularly important as most of the functions you will write will work with vectors.

There are two types of vectors:

1. *Atomic vectors*, of which there are six types: logical, integer, double, character, complex, and raw. Integer and double vectors are collectively known as *numeric vectors*. Integers have one special value: `NA`, while doubles have four: `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf`. All three special values `NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf` can arise during division:
 
 
```{r }
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0

```


2. *Lists*, which are sometimes called recursive vectors because lists can contain other lists. 

The chief difference between atomic vectors and lists is that atomic vectors are homogeneous, while lists can be heterogeneous. There’s one other related object: `NULL`. `NULL` is often used to represent the *absence of a vector* (as opposed to `NA` which is used to represent the *absence of a value in a vector*). NULL typically behaves like a vector of length 0. 


*In short:*

NaN  : means 0/0 -- Stands for "Not a Number"

NA   : is generally interpreted as a missing value, does not exist. Stand for "Not Available"

NULL : is for "empty object".



Every vector has two key properties:

1. Its type, which you can determine with `typeof()``.

```{r }
typeof(letters)

typeof(1:10)

typeof(TRUE)

typeof(1999)

typeof(1.8888888)

```
2. Its length, which you can determine with `length()`.

```{r }

x <- list("a", "b", 1:10)
length(x)

```
 
Vectors can also contain arbitrary additional metadata in the form of attributes. These attributes are used to create augmented vectors which build on additional behaviour. There are three important types of augmented vector:

1. *Factors* are built on top of integer vectors.
2. *Dates* and *date-times* are built on top of numeric vectors.
3. *Data frames* and *tibbles* are built on top of lists.
 
If you want to get the length of a vector in a data frame, you cannot type `length()` anymore. What you do is:

```{r }
# create a vector
x <- c("a", "b", 1:10)

# convert it to a tibble
x <- as.tibble(x)

# get the length of the tibble
length(x)

# get the number of rows x is composed of
nrow(x)

```
 
 
The four most important types of atomic vector are *logical*, *integer*, *double*, and *character*.
 
## Tales and indexing
Let's upload data. There are several datasets in-build in R. 

In order to learn something about R, we have prepared some data exploration tasks for you, using the `mpg` data frame found in ggplot2 (aka `ggplot2::mpg`).
The data frame mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car


Check out the different types of variables of our data frame, labeled right under the headline:
```{r}
mpg
```

For example, `manufacturer` is a character variable, `displ`, the car’s engine size in litres, is a double and `year` is an integer. You can also check this by typing:

```{r }
# Compactly display the structure of an arbitrary R object
str(mpg)

# Check the command using
?str
```

To learn even more about `mpg` and the meaning of its variables, open its help page by running ?mpg.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mpg
```
 


To pick only several observations or variables you can use indexing: 
data[rows, columns]
```{r }
data[1:5,]
```

Use head() to print first rows of your data


```{r}
head (mpg)
tail(mpg)
```


You can summarise data using summary(). How many observations are in the data set? What is max amount of cylinders recorded?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(mpg)
```

For beatiful tables in markdown you can use kable() from "knitr" library.

```{r }
library("knitr")
kable(mpg[1:5,], caption = "Knitr Table")
```
 

Let's check out the other types of variables, such as:

```{r }
# We force our data frame to be a tibble in order to dynamically expand our data set
data <- as_tibble(mpg)


# adds a column to our tibble with a logical variable
data %>% add_column(data$manufacturer =="audi")
data %>% add_column("20thCentury" = data$year < 2000)

```



#### Exercise:
Get the length of the above created variable "manufacturer".

```{r }

# adds a column to our tibble with a logical variable
data %>% add_column(data$manufacturer =="audi")


# Get the length of the above created variable "manufacturer"
???

```
 
 
## Writing functions

Recall that vectors are important as most of the functions work with vectors.

You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code). 

There are three key steps to creating a new function:

1. You need to pick a *name* for the function. Make sure it's reasonable!

2. You list the inputs, or *arguments*, to the function inside `function`. If we had e.g. three arguments, the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.

3. You place the code you have developed in *body* of the function, a { block that immediately follows `function(...)`.

Look at this function:


```{r }

count_cars <- function(tib, brand) {
  
  sum(tib$manufacturer == brand)
  
}

count_cars(data, "ford")


```

#### Exercise!

Write a function that returns how many of the cars in `mpg` were produced in 1999. FIll in the XXX and test your function in the end:


```{r, eval = FALSE }

# Function that returns how many of the cars in `mpg` were produced in 1999
XXX <- function(XXX) {
  
  XXX
  
}

# Test my function (solution: 117)
XXX(XXX)

# Can you also tell me how many were produced in 2008?
XXX(XXX)

```


An if statement allows you to conditionally execute code. It looks like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE }

if (condition) {
  # code executed when condition is TRUE
} else {
  # code executed when condition is FALSE
}

```

Example:

```{r, eval = FALSE }

if (data$year[3] == 2008) {
  print("Car was produced in 2008")
} else {
  print("Car was NOT produced in 2008")
}

if (data$year[7] == 1999) {
  print("Car was produced in 2008")
} else {
  print("Car was NOT produced in 2008")
}


# Better write a function for this!
check_year <- function(position, year) {
  
  if (data$year[position] == year) {
  print("Car was produced in ")
  print(year)
} else {
  #print("Car was NOT produced in" + year )
}

}

# Check the function
check_year(3, 2008)

```


## iterations

The last topic for today are for - loops.

In functions, we talked about how important it is to reduce duplication in your code by creating functions instead of copying-and-pasting. Reducing code duplication has three main benefits:

1. It’s easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what’s different, not what stays the same.

2. It’s easier to respond to changes in requirements. As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code.

3. You’re likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.


Consider again our example with the cars. This time, we want to know how many cars there are of each brand. We could check it out for each brand individually:


```{r}

# get all brands
unique(data$manufacturer)

sum(data$manufacturer == "audi")
sum(data$manufacturer == "chevrolet")
sum(data$manufacturer == "dodge")
# .
# .
# .
sum(data$manufacturer == "volkswagen")
```

You might see that this is tedious and cumbersome to do for so many brands.

So, how to use loops?

Every for loop has three components:

1. The *output*: `output <- vector("double", length()/nrow()/ncol()/...)`. Before you start the loop, you must always allocate sufficient space for the output. This is very important for efficiency: if you grow the for loop at each iteration using `c()` (for example), your for loop will be very slow.

A general way of creating an empty vector of given length is the `vector()` function. It has two arguments: the type of the vector (“logical”, “integer”, “double”, “character”, etc) and the length of the vector.


2. The *sequence*: `i in seq_along(data_frame)`. This determines what to loop over: each run of the for loop will assign `i` to a different value from `seq_along(df)`. It’s useful to think of `i` as a pronoun, like “it”.

You might not have seen `seq_along()` before. It’s a safe version of the familiar `1:length(l)`, with an important difference: if you have a zero-length vector, `seq_along()` does the right thing:


```{r}

y <- vector("double", 0)
seq_along(y)
#> integer(0)

1:length(y)
#> [1] 1 0

```
   

You probably won’t create a zero-length vector deliberately, but it’s easy to create them accidentally. If you use `1:length(x)` instead of `seq_along(x)`, you’re likely to get a confusing error message.

3. The *body*: `output[[i]] <- function(data_frame[[i]])`. This is the code that does the work. It’s run repeatedly, each time with a different value for `i`. The first iteration will run `output[[1]] <- function(data_frame[[1]])`, the second will run `output[[2]] <- function(data_frame[[2]])`, and so on.



Here is what our function would look like:
```{r}

# get all brands
unique(data$manufacturer)

# Create the output vector
output = vector("double", length(unique(data$manufacturer)))

# iterate over the brands
for(i in seq_along(unique(data$manufacturer))) {
  output[[i]] <- sum(data$manufacturer == unique(data$manufacturer)[i])
}


output
  
```
