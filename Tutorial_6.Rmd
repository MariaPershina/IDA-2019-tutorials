## Statistical Models 
    + what is a model
    
    + why do we need them 
    + models vs distributions (add plots!!!!)
 
    
## Binomial

 $$P(A) = \binom{N}{k} \cdot p^k(1-p)^{N-k}$$

<!-- I would include the purpose of the binomial model, i.e. you want to count the number k of successes out of N trials  -->

Three assumptions:
 - only two possible outcomes (success or failure)
 - probability of success is the same for each replication
 - the observations are independent

Mean: $\mu = np$


Standard Deviation: $\sigma=\sqrt{n(p)(1-p)}$

## Example
Each day of a month a student learns 10 new words
Aprox. 10% would be forgotten 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
forgotten <- rbinom(30, 10,.10)
plot(forgotten)
```

## More on Binomial distribution

```{r, echo=TRUE}
### <b>
dens<- dbinom(30, 300, .1)#probability density distribution   
prob <- pbinom(30, 300, .1) #cumulative probability of an event.
quantile<- qbinom(0.54, 300, .1) # takes the probability value and gives a number whose cumulative value matches the probability value
### </b>
round(dens, 3)
round(prob,3)
quantile
```



## Normal

$$P(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma*\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$
 
- mean, median and mode of the distribution coincide
- curve of the distribution is symmetrical about the mean.

<!-- true, but maybe it would be nice to say that this is a common thing for all continuous distributions, it's not specific to the normal distribution -->
- total area under the curve is 1. 

If $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ It is called standard normal distribution

## Example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
norm <- rnorm(100)
mu<- mean(norm)
median_ <- median(norm)
plot(norm, main=paste("Mean:",round(mu,2), "Median:", round(median_,2) )) 
```

## Density
```{r, echo=TRUE}
dens <-density(norm)
plot(dens, main = "Density of sampled data")
```



## Sampling

```{r, echo=TRUE}
### <b>
mu <- 100 
sigma <- 15
n_samples <- 10000

simulation <- tibble(sample = 1:n_samples, x = NA)

# Maybe you could use this instead of the for-loop? Should lead to the same tibble
# simulation <- tibble(sample = 1:n_samples, x = rnorm(n = n_samples, mean = mu, sd = sigma))

for(i in 1:n_samples){
  # sample a set of values
  sample_value <- rnorm(n = 1,
                         mean = mu,
                         sd = sigma)
  # save value to data frame
  simulation$x[i] <- sample_value
}
### </b>
```

## Plot 
```{r}
simulation %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 150)) +
  xlab("value") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  ylim(0,300) +
  theme_classic()
```

## Sampling mean
```{r, warning= FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

sample_size <- 14 
sample_means <- tibble(sample = 1:n_samples,
                           mean = NA,
                           std_dev = NA)

for(i in 1:n_samples){
  sample_values <- rnorm(n = sample_size <- 14 ,
                         mean = mu,
                         sd = sigma)
  sample_means$mean[i] <- mean(sample_values)
}
```

## Plot sampled mean

```{r}
sample_means %>%
  ggplot(aes(mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
 scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 150))+
  xlab("Sampled mean") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  theme_classic()
```

## T-model
- used to compare means of two distrubutions
- both distributions  should come from one family (e.g.normal)
- $\delta$ indicates differences between the means

<!-- Maybe a few more details on the purpose / application of the likelihood would be nice -->
## Log likelihood 
$$\log\prod x_i=log\sum x_i$$


## Which model to use? {.build}
    - if you are intrested in how much beer should you buy for a party?
    - if you want to check if male height is different among Norh and South Koreans?
    - if you want to check whether a new drink increases sense of humor?
