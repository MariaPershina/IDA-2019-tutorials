## Content 

- Bootstrapping  
- Probability recap

- Statistical Models 
    + what is a model
    + why do we need them 
    + models vs distributions (add plots!!!!)
    + exercise : which model to use for an experiment
    + demos with wrong models...

- Parameters
    + plots
    + priors (which priors???)
    
- Frequentists vs. Bayesians

## Bootstrapping
- to do sth *by one's own bootstraps*
    + to do sth by one's own initiative and effort, with little to no assistance

- in statistics
    + idea: we have limited data at hand and we need to put in our own "effort" to get the most out of the data
    + practice: random **re-samples with replacement**


## Bootstrapping    
- specifically for 95% **Confidence Intervals** (e.g. of the mean)
    + vector $D$ with length $k$
    
    <br>
    1. take $k$ samples (**with replacement!**) from $D$, gather them in a vector $D^{rep}$
    2. compute $\mu(D^{rep})$ and add it to the vector $\mu_{sampled}$
    3. repeat 1 and 2
    4. **lower bound** of the 95% CI = **2.5% quantile** of $\mu_{sampled}$
    5. **upper bound** of the 95% CI = **97.5% quantile** of $\mu_{sampled}$


## Probability Recap
- **marginal**: the prob. of one event happening
    + e.g. $P(heads) = \frac{1}{2}, \ P(spades) = \frac{1}{4}$

- **joint**: the prob. of many events happening at the same time
    + if *heads* and *spades* are independent: $P(heads, \ spades) = P(heads) \cdot (spades)$

<br>

- **conditional**: the prob. of an event when you know another event already happened
    + $P(A \ | \ B) = \frac{P(A, \ B)}{P(B)}$
    + e.g. $P(heads) = \frac{1}{2}, \ P(heads \ | \ unfair) = \frac{3}{4}$
    
    
## Bayes' Rule
- $P(\theta \ | \ D) = \frac{P(D \ | \ \theta) \cdot P(\theta)}{P(D)}$

- **rewrite** a certain probability in terms of **other probabilities** that might be much easier to compute
- gain insight into the ***unobservable*** causes of any given observation
    + for data analysis: starting from the **raw data**, gain insight into the (parameters of the) **underlying distribution** that generated the data at hand
    
## Bayes' Rule: Example (if needed)

## Parameters
- Insert plot grid of standard distributions here

plot(pressure)
